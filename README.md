1. **Search Engine**  
A **Search Engine** is an information retrieval system designed to help locate information stored within a computer system. Search engines act as web librarians. They collect, analyze, and store data to facilitate quick and accurate information retrieval. The operation mechanism of a search engine typically involves three steps: Crawling, Indexing, and Ranking.

2. **PageRank**  
**PageRank** is a scoring system used by Google to determine the importance of a website. PageRank is calculated on a logarithmic scale from 1 to 10, based on the quantity and quality of links pointing to the website. Websites with high PageRank tend to rank higher on SERP (Search Engine Results Page), making PageRank crucial for website optimization. Examples of websites with high PageRank include google.com, facebook.com, and youtube.com.

3. **SEO**  
**SEO** stands for Search Engine Optimization, a process of applying techniques and strategies to enhance the position and visibility of a website on search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and others. SEO helps a website appear at high positions in "organic" (or free) search results when users search for keywords or phrases related to the website's content. SEO is a key element in a company's online business strategy, as it can increase brand recognition, website traffic, potential customers, credibility, and e-commerce readiness. SEO consists of four fundamental principles: Keywords, On-page, Backlinks, and Off-page.

- **Keywords** are words or phrases that users input into a search engine when seeking information, products, or services. Keywords are crucial to determining the content and goals of a website. Carefully researched and selected keywords should align with the target audience, accessibility, and search trends.

- **On-Page** involves optimizing on-site factors, including content, meta tags, titles, URLs, images, source code, and page loading speed. The goal of On-Page is to make the website easily crawled, indexed, and understood by search engines, providing users with a positive experience when accessing the site.

- **Backlinks** are links from other websites to ours. They play a vital role in ranking a website on search engines because they reflect the importance, quality, and credibility of the website. Seeking and building backlinks from relevant and high-quality websites is essential, while avoiding backlinks from spammy, unrelated, or harmful sites.

- **Off-Page** involves building online credibility for a website. It includes activities performed outside the website to create trust and enhance the website's reputation in the eyes of search engines and users. Off-Page SEO activities mainly include building backlinks, encouraging brand searches, increasing engagement, and sharing on social networks. It helps the website improve its position in search results and attract traffic from external sources.
